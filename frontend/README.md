# Notes on Uploading and Deleting Files with Node.js

## Uploading Directory

This line creates the directory specified in `uploadPath` synchronously using Node.js's `fs` module:

```js
fs.mkdirSync(uploadPath, { recursive: true });
```

### Explanation

- `mkdirSync` is a method to **make a directory synchronously**.
- `uploadPath` is the path to create (e.g., `uploads/posts/123`).
- `{ recursive: true }` means:
  - If any parent folders (like `uploads/` or `uploads/posts/`) don’t exist, they’ll be automatically created.
  - Without `recursive: true`, it would throw an error if parent folders are missing.

## Deleting a File

You **don't need to use `multer` to delete a file**, and you **should not use `_removeFile`** since it's a private function.

Instead, delete the file using Node.js’s `fs.unlink` method.

### Example

Wherever you have access to `req.file`, you can do the following:

```js
const fs = require("fs");

if (req.file) {
  fs.unlink(req.file.path, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error("Error deleting the file:", err);
    } else {
      console.log("File successfully deleted");
    }
  });
}
```

> ✅ This is the standard and safe way to remove files using Node.js.

# ⚠️ Avoid Mutating While Iterating: A Must-Know for Clean Code

When working with structures like `FormData`, arrays, maps, sets, or objects—**never modify them directly (add/delete items) while you're looping over them.**

---

## 💡 Why Is This a Problem?

Mutating during iteration causes **unpredictable behavior**:

- Items might get **skipped**.
- The loop might behave **inconsistently**.
- You might silently miss data or even introduce bugs.

---

## ✅ The Right Way: Copy Before You Mutate

If you need to modify something while looping, **make a copy first**.

### ✅ Good Example: Working with `FormData`

```ts
const form = new FormData();
// ...form gets populated...

// Step 1: Copy entries into an array
const entries = Array.from(form.entries());

// Step 2: Now it's safe to iterate and mutate
for (const [key, value] of entries) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
  form.delete(key); // ✅ Safe mutation
}
```

# 📘 Redux Toolkit: Async Thunk & Loading State

## 🧩 Topic  
Managing the loading state during an `asyncThunk` that also dispatches synchronous reducers like `deleteList`.

---

## ✅ How `createAsyncThunk` Works

When you dispatch an `asyncThunk` (e.g., `removeNotifList`), Redux Toolkit automatically dispatches **three lifecycle actions**:

- **`pending`** – Dispatched immediately when the thunk starts  
  → `state.loading = true`

- **`fulfilled`** – Dispatched when the async function completes successfully  
  → `state.loading = false`

- **`rejected`** – Dispatched when the async function throws or uses `rejectWithValue`  
  → `state.loading = false`

### 🔍 Internal Flow

- All async logic is handled inside a `try/catch` block.
- You can dispatch **synchronous reducers** (e.g., `deleteList`) **inside** the thunk.
- The loading state remains `true` until the thunk resolves (either fulfilled or rejected).
- Even if local state updates are synchronous, the `loading` flag is not reset until the async operation ends.

---

## 🔁 Example Flow

```ts
dispatch(removeNotifList("123")); 
// → state.loading = true  (pending)

await API call...

dispatch(deleteList("123")); 
// → updates local state (e.g., remove item from UI)

return result;
// → state.loading = false (fulfilled)
```

---

## 🧠 Important Notes

- The `loading` state is **tied to the async thunk’s lifecycle**, not the time taken by internal reducers.
- Synchronous reducers like `deleteList` **do not affect** the timing of `pending` or `fulfilled` actions.
- If a reducer is **computationally expensive** (e.g., `O(n)` or more), it might still cause a **UI freeze** unless:
  - It’s optimized (e.g., batched updates, memoization)
  - Or offloaded (e.g., to a web worker)

---

💡 Use this structure to confidently manage async and sync logic together while keeping your UI responsive and predictable.
